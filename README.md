Tracker for planes passing by my house. Alerts the user when the plane goes by so the user can look out the window!!

This project is also helping me learn Python basic syntax and helping me get back into coding!!

I intend to write this onto a LCD screen using an arduino and have it near my desk. Far in the future, I'd love to get an external display that looks a bit nicer.

# initializing python environment

so I remember;

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
Initialization for new user:
```
pip install requests geopy
```

To run:
```
python runner.py
```
